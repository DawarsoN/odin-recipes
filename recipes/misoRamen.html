    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Here is the recipe for the delicious Miso ramen. The ramen broth is made using fermented soybeen paste, called miso, giving it its unique flavor.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon cooking oil</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white miso paste</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>6 cups low-sodium chicken or vegetable stock</li>
        <li>1/3 cup coconut milk (use canned regular coconut milk usually found in the international aisle)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 4 ounce packets instant ramen noodles (discard the seasoning packets)</li>
        <li>5 ounces baby spinach</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>green onions, thinlu sliced</li>
        <li>sesame seeds, white or black, for serving (optional)</li>
        <li>sriracha, toasted sesame oil, or chili oil, for serving (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a small pot of water for the eggs to a boil.</li>
        <li>While water is coming to a boil, place a large heavy-bottomed pot over medium oil. Add oil. When the oil is hot, add miso and garlic. Stir for a minute. Slowly pour stock and coconut milk over miso while whisking to fully dissolve all of the miso. Stir in soy sauce. Bring the broth to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, return to the pot for the eggs and reduce to a low simmer. Gently lower the eggs into simmering water. Simmer for 7 minutes if eggs are at room temperature and 8 minutes if eggs have been refrigerated. (Be sure to set a timer right after you add the eggs to the water so they don’t overcook.)</li>
        <li>When the miso broth is simmering, stir in the noodles and the spinach. Simmer until the ramen is just tender (check the package for recommended time; don’t overcook).</li>
        <li>Divide the ramen and broth between serving bowls.</li>
        <li>Run the eggs under cold tap water until they are cool enough to touch. Peel the eggs and slice in half. Arrange eggs on top of each bowl of ramen. Serve with green onions, sesame seeds, and Sriracha or chili oil on top.</li>
    </ol>
